# EV Charging Model in Simulink
Final project for Hybrid and Embedded systems

# Steps to Run

1. Install MATLAB (at least 2022)
2. Load the final_project.slx
3. (Do this step only if it doesn't run on the first try) Go to the Grid component, double click the scenario editor. Load the prices.slx.mat file.

The simulink model should pretty much run after that.
